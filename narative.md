It's a cold spring day but the sun is shining. The winter was bad and most of the supplies you'd saved for the end of the world have been used up. They didn't last as long as you hoped, but then again you never quite believed it would happen.

->Supplies
* Garden Supplies
* Food
* Parts
* Tools
* Clothes

-> Garden Supplies
* 5lbs Vermiculite
* Seed packets

-> me
The upturn in weather leaves me more optimistic than I've been all winter. I need to work hard to have enough food for the year. I'm a little hungry but I should probably get some work done before breakfast.

-> Tools

* Watering can
* Shovel

-> Food
* 2 Cans of Garbonzo Beans
* 3 Can of Lima Beans (Who buys these?)
* 3 cans of green beans
* 10 lbs of long grain rice
